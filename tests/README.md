# Multi-Domain SFI Tests

This directory will be used to contain all tests written for the multi-domain SFI clang compiler pass implementation. As the number of tests are increased, an automated tool will be developed that performs all test compilations and verifies all output.

In the meantime, example program source code will be placed in this directory with comments at the top of each file on how to compile the code using the multi-domain SFI clang compiler pass and what to look for in the output to verify the correct behavior.

It is recommended to perform these tests on a Linux machine, as correct behavior has not yet been tested on OSX or Windows.
